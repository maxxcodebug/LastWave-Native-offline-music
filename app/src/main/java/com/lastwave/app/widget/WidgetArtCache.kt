/**
 * Holds the current track's art bitmap in memory, keyed by track. The

 * [com.lastwave.app.service.MediaScrobbleListenerService] (straight off
 * MediaMetadata) — decoding it back from the on-disk PNG cache
 * (widget_now_playing_art.png) on every single widget recomposition was
 * pure wasted work and the main source of the widget feeling slow to
 * update. The file cache still exists (see [WidgetUpdater]) purely as a
 * cold-start fallback for right after a process restart, before the
 * scrobbler service has reconnected and republished anything.
